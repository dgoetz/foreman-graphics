This directory contains the SVG and Ostrich font used in the sticker, and can
be edited in Inkscape. The die-cut shape is a separate layer.  The font has
more weights too, available here under the SIL open font license:

Note that due to the complex masks and SVG effects in the Foreman logo, the
hard hat and the FOREMAN part are a bitmap. This avoids any rendering issues
when being printed, but has the side effect that  printing the sticker much
larger will result in pixelation. IF you need it larger, contact `tigert`.
