# Misty CMaj7 chord

A short (30 sec) clip of a piano chord, used as a sound effect on our YouTube
channel.

## Origins

A theme followed by C major seventh chord played on Roland FP-30 piano,
recorded in Waveform 11 music software and rendered via PianoTeq 7 LV2 plugin
on Fedora Linux 32. The first three notes are actually from
[Misty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_(song)) jazz standard composed by
Errol Garner in 1954.

The sound was compressed with loseless FLAC and is available as
`Misty-CMaj7.flac`, can be converted to WAV or any other format. Waveform
archive is also available with MIDI notes and rendered track for archival
reasons.
